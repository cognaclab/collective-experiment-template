A **template-based platform** for creating online collective cognitive behavior experiments. Researchers can build custom experiments using simple Markdown and YAML files, without coding. The system generates interactive web-based experiments with real-time multiplayer functionality.

**Default Experiment**: A 'collective reward' multi-player bandit task where a group of players each chooses a bandit option, and only the total sum of payoffs is shown as feedback (individual payoffs are not available).

## üìù Creating Your Own Experiment

**Quick Start**: Copy the template, edit content, generate, and test!

```bash
# 1. Copy the template experiment
cp -r content/experiments/default content/experiments/my-experiment

# 2. Edit your content files (see INSTRUCTIONS.md for details)
# Edit: config.yaml, sequences/main.yaml, instructions/*.md

# 3. Generate JavaScript from your content  
npm run scenes:generate

# 4. Test your experiment
npm run dev:web
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

üìñ **Detailed Guide**: See [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) for complete step-by-step instructions.

## üöÄ Quick Start & Development

### Development Mode (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development with automatic scene generation
npm run dev
# This runs: scenes:watch + dev:web + dev:game

# Or start components separately:
npm run scenes:generate    # Generate scenes from content
npm run scenes:watch       # Watch content changes  
npm run dev:web           # Start web server
npm run dev:game          # Start game server
```

### Production Mode

```bash
# Start the applications with PM2
pm2 start bin/www --name collective_reward_static --log ../logs --time --max-memory-restart 1G
pm2 start gameServer.js --name collective_reward_game
```

### Restart the Applications

```bash
pm2 restart collective_reward_static --log ../logs --time --max-memory-restart 1G
pm2 restart collective_reward_game --log ./logs --time --max-memory-restart 9G --node-args="--expose-gc"
```

## üß™ Experiment Architecture Overview

This web-based behavioral experiment system combines a **template-driven content system** with a robust real-time multiplayer architecture. Below is a breakdown of its core components:

### üé® Scene Template System (New)

- **Content-Driven Design**  
  Experiments are defined using Markdown files (`instructions/*.md`) and YAML configuration (`config.yaml`, `sequences/main.yaml`). No JavaScript coding required for basic experiments.

- **Conditional Content Engine**  
  Dynamic text rendering based on experimental conditions (group vs. individual, static vs. dynamic environments) using simple `{if condition="group"}` syntax in Markdown.

- **Automatic Code Generation**  
  The scene generator (`scripts/generate-scenes.js`) converts Markdown content into Phaser.js scene classes, bridging researcher-friendly content with technical implementation.

- **Hybrid Architecture**  
  Simple instruction/text scenes use the template system, while complex interactive scenes (gameplay, tutorials) remain as custom Phaser code, providing both ease-of-use and flexibility.

### üñ•Ô∏è Server-Side (Real-Time Game Management)

- **Node.js + Express + Socket.IO**  
  The backend is implemented in `gameServer.js`, using Express for routing and static file serving, and Socket.IO for handling real-time communication with clients.

- **Group Formation Logic**  
  Participants are automatically assigned to experimental "rooms" upon joining. A room stays open until it reaches a defined `maxGroupSize` (e.g., 10 participants) or until it reaches a `maxWaitingTime`, whichever earlier. Once full, a new room is dynamically opened up to form another group. This enables synchronised multiplayer sessions with independent group structures.

- **Session Coordination and Experiment Flow**  
  The server handles waiting rooms, session timing, trial progression, environmental changes (e.g. static/dynamic reward probabilities), and game round transitions. It tracks each client‚Äôs session and manages reconnections via a fallback 'decoyRoom' to preserve data integrity.

- **Data Storage via MongoDB and Mongoose**  
  Participant actions, game state variables, timing, and outcome metrics are collected during the session and stored in a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Data is saved after every game session (`gameRound`) and during disconnection events, ensuring no loss of behavioural records.

---

### üïπÔ∏è Client-Side (Interactive Participant Interface)

- **Phaser Framework (`public/src/main.js`)**  
  The client interface is built with Phaser, a JavaScript game framework. It governs:
  - Scene transitions (waiting rooms, instruction screens, main task, feedback, questionnaire)
  - Real-time updates (e.g., countdowns, trial status)
  - Participant inputs and visual feedback

- **Socket.IO Client Integration**  
  Client-server communication is bi-directional via WebSockets. Each participant receives trial-specific parameters, group assignment info, and task configurations dynamically, ensuring synchronised experimental control across clients.

- **Behavioural Safeguards**  
  The client detects browser reloads and tab visibility changes to prevent duplicated entries or incomplete trials. Disconnected participants are routed to the final questionnaire stage with their data preserved.

---

### üîÑ Task Mechanics and Flow

1. **Joining**: Participant connects and is assigned to a room or individual condition based on latency and group availability.
2. **Waiting Room**: Real-time countdown starts. If enough participants join in time, a group session begins; otherwise, the participant proceeds individually.
3. **Tutorial + Comprehension Test**: Ensures participants understand the task before proceeding.
4. **Bandit Task**: Multiple rounds of collective decision-making where only the group-level payoff is shown.
5. **Feedback & Transition**: After each round, participants receive summary feedback before proceeding to the next round.
6. **Data Export**: All events are logged to MongoDB and can be exported via CLI using `mongoexport` (as shown in a later section).

---

This architecture allows researchers to conduct robust, real-time online experiments involving collective behaviour, feedback sharing, and adaptive choice under uncertainty.
