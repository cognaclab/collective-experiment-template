# Prisoner's Dilemma

## What is this experiment about?

You will be **paired with another participant** to play a simple decision-making game. In each round, you and your partner will both make a choice between two options:

- **Cooperate**
- **Defect**

## How does scoring work?

Your points depend on **both your choice and your partner's choice**:

| Your Choice | Partner's Choice | Your Points | Partner's Points |
|------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| Cooperate  | Cooperate        | **3**       | **3**            |
| Cooperate  | Defect           | **0**       | **5**            |
| Defect     | Cooperate        | **5**       | **0**            |
| Defect     | Defect           | **1**       | **1**            |
