# Task Instructions

## The 2-Armed Bandit Problem

You will see **2 colored boxes** on the screen:
- **Left box** and **Right box**
- Each box gives rewards with different probabilities
- One box is generally better than the other
- **Your goal**: Find the better box and choose it more often

## How Rewards Work
- Each time you choose a box, you might get **10 points** or **0 points**
- The probabilities are **fixed** throughout the task
- One box has a **higher chance** of giving rewards than the other
- You won't know which is better until you try them!

## Strategy Tips
- **Explore** both options early to learn their reward rates
- **Exploit** the better option once you find it  
- **Balance** learning vs. earning throughout the task

## Time Limit
- You have **{{maxChoiceStageTime/1000}} seconds** to make each choice
- If you don't choose in time, a random option will be selected
- Try to respond quickly but thoughtfully
