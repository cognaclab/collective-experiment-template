# Welcome!

Thank you for your interest in our study!

This study is divided in **two parts**.

## Study Overview

### Part 1: Group Decision-Making Game

In the **first part, a group decision-making game**, you will be asked to make a series of choices with other participants (i.e. teammates). Based on these decisions, your team will be able to earn some **bonus** that will be added to your participation fee.

This part of the study will be **played in groups** with other study participants. **In order to find enough participants (2 to 10 people)**, you might need to wait for up to **2 minutes** to begin with this part of the study. Do not worry about losing time during this process and please be patient: **You will be paid for the amount of time you have waited** and still attended to our study ({waiting_rate})!

### Part 2: Survey

In the **second part** of the study, you will be asked to fill out a short survey. This survey will help us to understand how you decided in part one. All results will be **collected fully confidentially**.

## Payment Information

Upon completion of the study, you will be paid **{base}** for your completion, plus any extra bonus you earned both in the waiting room and in the first part of the study (roughly up to {bonus_max}). The completion of the study should take about {duration}.

## Important Notes

{note}
1. Please make sure that **your internet connection is stable**, as it may also impact the study experience of other participants. If your internet **disconnects** during the first part of the study, **you will not be able to complete the study** and therefore not be eligible for the compensation.

2. Furthermore, **you can only participate once** and you will not be able to restart the study. Therefore, please **do not restart/reload your browser** once this study has started. **If you do so, part one of the study will be terminated automatically** and you will be directed to the survey part. This implies that you can only keep rewards that you have accumulated so far, but are not able to gain any additional rewards. If you abort part one of the study, this may also negatively affect the bonus of other participants, so please be considerate.
