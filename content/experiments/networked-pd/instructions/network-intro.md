# Network Interactions

## How Pairing Works

At the start of each round, you will be paired with **one other player** from your group.

### Partner Rotation

- Your partner changes throughout the game
- You may play with the same person multiple times
- You may play with some people more than others
- The pairing process considers who you can still interact with

### Network Connections

Think of your group as a **network** where you can interact with other players:

- **Initially**: You can interact with all 7 other players in your group
- **Over time**: Your network may change based on partner selection decisions
- **Connections**: You can only be paired with players you're still connected to

### Partner Information

Before each round, you will see:
- **Who your partner is** (e.g., "Player 5")
- **Your history with this partner** (how many times you've played together)
- **Past outcomes** (how many times each of you cooperated/defected)

This information can help you decide how to play with this particular partner.
