# Partner Selection

## Breaking Links

Every **5 rounds** (rounds 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30), after playing with your partner, you will have the option to make a decision about future interactions:

### The Choice

You will be asked:

> **"Do you want to continue interacting with this partner in future rounds?"**

You can choose:
- **Continue**: You remain connected and may be paired with this partner again
- **Break Link**: You disconnect from this partner and will NOT be paired with them again

### How It Works

- This decision is made **independently** by both players
- If **either player** chooses to break the link, the connection is severed
- Once broken, a link cannot be restored
- You don't immediately see what your partner chose (only the result)

### Effects on the Network

- **Fewer Partners**: Breaking links reduces your number of possible partners
- **Reciprocal**: When you break a link with someone, they also lose connection to you
- **Strategic Consideration**: Think carefully before breaking links - you may reduce your own opportunities

### Important Notes

- You can still earn points in future rounds even with fewer partners
- Other players' decisions affect who you can play with
- If you become disconnected from all players, you will sit out remaining rounds
- Partner selection votes are private and anonymous

Use this mechanism to shape who you interact with for the remainder of the experiment.
