# Prisoner's Dilemma Rules

## The Decision

In each round, you and your partner will simultaneously choose between two options:

- **COOPERATE** (Green button)
- **DEFECT** (Red button)

Neither player knows what the other chose until after both have decided.

## Payoffs

Your earnings depend on the combination of your choice and your partner's choice:

| Your Choice | Partner's Choice | Your Points | Partner's Points |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cooperate** | **Cooperate** | **3** | **3** |
| **Cooperate** | Defect | **0** | **5** |
| Defect | **Cooperate** | **5** | **0** |
| Defect | Defect | **1** | **1** |

## Key Points

- **Mutual Cooperation (3, 3)**: Both players do well when both cooperate
- **Defection Temptation (5, 0)**: You get the most points by defecting while your partner cooperates
- **Sucker's Payoff (0, 5)**: You get nothing if you cooperate while your partner defects
- **Mutual Defection (1, 1)**: Both players do poorly when both defect

## Strategy

There is no single "correct" answer. Your best strategy may depend on:
- What you think your partner will do
- Whether you want to build trust with partners you'll see again
- How much you value your own earnings vs. joint outcomes

Think carefully about each decision!
